Things implemented that weren't part of the requirements:
	In order to implement the scratchpad without having to worry about pointers, I created a
		neighbors[] that counts the neighbors of each cell before any changes.
	Implemented a "Stop" button but it doesn't completely work as planned quit yet.
	My HUD is placed above the graphicsPanel instead of written overtop of it.
	Made the font size relative the the cell height.
	All randomizations are inside a modal dialog.
	Implemented a x10 grid.
	Based which Run buttons are pressable based on timer.Enabled AND/OR what buttons have been
		pressed previously.
	Added shortkeys to all menu items, as well as made them viewable.
	Attemped to create an aspect ratio for the form window so that the graphicsPanel is always
		a square.
